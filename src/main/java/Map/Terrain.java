    * S:  scenic view.  Residential zones within 2 tiles gain a bonus of 10 points.  If you wish, you can build on a scenic site but it destroys the view.  Building on a scenic view has a cost of 1.
    * 1...9:  how difficult it is to build on that square.  To build a zone on any square costs 2+difficulty.  So building a Commercial zone on a square of difficulty 6 costs 8 points.  You will receive a penalty of that many points to put any zone on that square.
